An extension to [fluent-html](https://github.com/fewagency/fluent-html) for building accessible, well-formated, yet customizable HTML forms.

## Authors
I, Björn Nilsved, work at the largest communication agency in southern Sweden.
We call ourselves [FEW](http://fewagency.se) (oh, the irony).
From time to time we have positions open for web developers and programmers in the Malmö/Copenhagen area,
so please get in touch!
